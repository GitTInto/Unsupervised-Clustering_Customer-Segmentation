# Unsupervised-Clustering_Customer-Segmentation

## Business Use Case:

Why is Customer Segmentation Important? Customer segmentation is not only important, but vital, to optimize your marketing strategies, maximize a customer's value to your business, and improve customer experience and satisfaction.
Instead of a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach, successful segmentation clusters your customer data into groups sharing the same properties or behavioral characteristics, helping to drive dynamic content and personalization tactics for timelier, relevant, and more effective marketing communications. With such an unimaginable variety of people and personalities in the world, a potential market is usually not characterized singularly nor easily. It becomes important to know your target customer base to make sure your communications are both effective (attractive, action-promoting) and appropriate (non-offensive, timely, and relevant). The segmentation process begins by grouping customers and potential customers into customer segments with similar characteristics, such that you can communicate to all the individuals in that segment efficiently, yet still effectively and with a sense of personal attention, without contacting everyone separately. Your marketing tactics thus become more effective and efficient, which will not only save you time and money, but will enhance the benefits as well.
Segmentation allows businesses to make better use of their marketing budgets, gain a competitive edge over rival companies and, importantly, demonstrate a better knowledge of your customers’ needs and wants. It can also help:
Marketing efficiency – Breaking down a large customer base into more manageable pieces, making it easier to identify your target audience and launch campaigns to the most relevant people, using the most relevant channel.
Determine new market opportunities – During the process of grouping your customers into clusters, you may find that you have identified a new market segment, which could in turn alter your marketing focus and strategy to fit.
Better brand strategy – Once you have identified the key motivators for your customer, such as design or price or practical needs, you can brand your products appropriately.
Improve distribution strategies – Identifying where customers shop and when can informatively shape product distributions strategies, such as what type of products are sold at outlets.
Customer retention – Using segmentation, marketers can identify groups that require extra attention and those that churn quick, along with customers with the highest potential value. It can also help with creating targeted strategies that capture your customers’ attention and create positive, high-value experiences with your brands. 


## Method
	
Here the first step is to understand the data, the features and the domain. Then we go about cleaning the data. After which we need to look at the features and convert any categorical features into numerical and then based on the problem we are trying to solve or the business use case, we will need to do some feature engineering. After the feature engineering we will do encoding and then we do feature scaling. After all the features are ready, then we use clustering and add the cluster values to the original dataframe and then we profile the customers.
